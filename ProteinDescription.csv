Protein^Description
P31946^Adapter protein implicated in the regulation of a large spectrum of both general and specialized signaling pathways. Binds to a large number of partners, usually by recognition of a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motif. Binding generally results in the modulation of the activity of the binding partner. Negative regulator of osteogenesis. Blocks the nuclear translocation of the phosphorylated form (by AKT1) of SRPK2 and antagonizes its stimulatory effect on cyclin D1 expression resulting in blockage of neuronal apoptosis elicited by SRPK2. Negative regulator of signaling cascades that mediate activation of MAP kinases via AKAP13.

P01889^Antigen-presenting major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) molecule. In complex with B2M/beta 2 microglobulin displays primarily viral and tumor-derived peptides on antigen-presenting cells for recognition by alpha-beta T cell receptor (TCR) on HLA-B-restricted CD8-positive T cells, guiding antigen-specific T cell immune response to eliminate infected or transformed cells (PubMed:25808313, PubMed:29531227, PubMed:9620674, PubMed:23209413). May also present self-peptides derived from the signal sequence of secreted or membrane proteins, although T cells specific for these peptides are usually inactivated to prevent autoreactivity (PubMed:7743181, PubMed:18991276). Both the peptide and the MHC molecule are recognized by TCR, the peptide is responsible for the fine specificity of antigen recognition and MHC residues account for the MHC restriction of T cells (PubMed:29531227, PubMed:9620674, PubMed:24600035). Typically presents intracellular peptide antigens of 8 to 13 amino acids that arise from cytosolic proteolysis via constitutive proteasome and IFNG-induced immunoproteasome (PubMed:23209413). Can bind different peptides containing allele-specific binding motifs, which are mainly defined by anchor residues at position 2 and 9 (PubMed:25808313, PubMed:29531227).
P63151^The B regulatory subunit might modulate substrate selectivity and catalytic activity, and also might direct the localization of the catalytic enzyme to a particular subcellular compartment. Essential for serine/threonine-protein phosphatase 2A-mediated dephosphorylation of WEE1, preventing its ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, increasing WEE1 protein levels, and promoting the G2/M checkpoint (PubMed:33108758).
P11171^Protein 4.1 is a major structural element of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton. It plays a key role in regulating membrane physical properties of mechanical stability and deformability by stabilizing spectrin-actin interaction. Recruits DLG1 to membranes. Required for dynein-dynactin complex and NUMA1 recruitment at the mitotic cell cortex during anaphase (PubMed:23870127).
P41595^G-protein coupled receptor for 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) (PubMed:8143856, PubMed:7926008, PubMed:8078486, PubMed:8882600, PubMed:18703043, PubMed:23519210).Also functions as a receptor for various ergot alkaloid derivatives and psychoactive substances (PubMed:8143856, PubMed:7926008, PubMed:8078486, PubMed:12970106, PubMed:18703043, PubMed:23519210, PubMed:23519215, PubMed:24357322, PubMed:28129538).Ligand binding causes a conformation change that triggers signaling via guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and modulates the activity of down-stream effectors (PubMed:8143856, PubMed:8078486, PubMed:8882600, PubMed:23519215, PubMed:28129538).Beta-arrestin family members inhibit signaling via G proteins and mediate activation of alternative signaling pathways (PubMed:23519215, PubMed:28129538).Signaling activates a phosphatidylinositol-calcium second messenger system that modulates the activity of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and down-stream signaling cascades and promotes the release of Ca2+ ions from intracellular stores (PubMed:8143856, PubMed:8078486, PubMed:8882600, PubMed:18703043, PubMed:23519215, PubMed:28129538).Plays a role in the regulation of dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine release, 5-hydroxytryptamine uptake and in the regulation of extracellular dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine levels, and thereby affects neural activity. May play a role in the perception of pain (By similarity).Plays a role in the regulation of behavior, including impulsive behavior (PubMed:21179162).Required for normal proliferation of embryonic cardiac myocytes and normal heart development. Protects cardiomyocytes against apoptosis. Plays a role in the adaptation of pulmonary arteries to chronic hypoxia. Plays a role in vasoconstriction. Required for normal osteoblast function and proliferation, and for maintaining normal bone density. Required for normal proliferation of the interstitial cells of Cajal in the intestine (By similarity).
Q88FY2^Flavin-dependent monooxygenase (FMO) that catalyzes the decarboxylative hydroxylation of 6-hydroxynicotinic acid (6-HNA) to 2,5-dihydroxypyridine (2,5-DHP) with concomitant oxidation of NADH, a step in the aerobic nicotinate degradation pathway.
