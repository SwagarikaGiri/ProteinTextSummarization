P31946^Adapter protein implicated in the regulation of a large spectrum of both general and specialized signaling pathways. Binds to a large number of partners, usually by recognition of a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motif. Binding generally results in the modulation of the activity of the binding partner. Negative regulator of osteogenesis. Blocks the nuclear translocation of the phosphorylated form (by AKT1) of SRPK2 and antagonizes its stimulatory effect on cyclin D1 expression resulting in blockage of neuronal apoptosis elicited by SRPK2. Negative regulator of signaling cascades that mediate activation of MAP kinases via AKAP13.
P62258^Adapter protein implicated in the regulation of a large spectrum of both general and specialized signaling pathways. Binds to a large number of partners, usually by recognition of a phosphoserine or phosphothreonine motif. Binding generally results in the modulation of the activity of the binding partner (By similarity).
Positively regulates phosphorylated protein HSF1 nuclear export to the cytoplasm (PubMed:12917326).
Q01574^Catalyzes the production of acetyl-CoA. Provides the acetyl-CoA source for histone acetylation in the nucleus. 'Aerobic' isozyme of acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase, which supports growth on nonfermentable carbon sources such as glycerol and ethanol. May be required for assimilation of ethanol and acetate
P05095^F-actin cross-linking protein which is thought to anchor actin to a variety of intracellular structures. This is a bundling protein. Increases the actin-stimulated ATPase activity of myosin. Involved in vegetative cell growth, phagocytosis, motility and development, probably through stabilization of the actin network in the cortical cytoskeleton.
P30038^Irreversible conversion of delta-1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C), derived either from proline or ornithine, to glutamate. This is a necessary step in the pathway interconnecting the urea and tricarboxylic acid cycles. The preferred substrate is glutamic gamma-semialdehyde, other substrates include succinic, glutaric and adipic semialdehydes.
P30533^Molecular chaperone for LDL receptor-related proteins that may regulate their ligand binding activity along the secretory pathway.
Q9BTT0^Histone chaperone that specifically mediates the genome-wide removal of histone H2A.Z/H2AZ1 from the nucleosome: removes H2A.Z/H2AZ1 from its normal sites of deposition, especially from enhancer and insulator regions. Not involved in deposition of H2A.Z/H2AZ1 in the nucleosome. May stabilize the evicted H2A.Z/H2AZ1-H2B dimer, thus shifting the equilibrium towards dissociation and the off-chromatin state (PubMed:24463511).
Inhibits activity of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Does not inhibit protein phosphatase 1. May play a role in cerebellar development and synaptogenesis.
Q64438^Has ribonuclease activity (in vitro). Seems to lack angiogenic activity.
Q9MAT5^Methylates (mono and asymmetric dimethylation) the guanidino nitrogens of arginyl residues in some proteins. Essential for regulating flowering time.
P04083^Plays important roles in the innate immune response as effector of glucocorticoid-mediated responses and regulator of the inflammatory process. Has anti-inflammatory activity (PubMed:8425544).
Plays a role in glucocorticoid-mediated down-regulation of the early phase of the inflammatory response (By similarity).
Promotes resolution of inflammation and wound healing (PubMed:25664854).Functions at least in part by activating the formyl peptide receptors and downstream signaling cascades (PubMed:15187149, PubMed:25664854).
Promotes chemotaxis of granulocytes and monocytes via activation of the formyl peptide receptors (PubMed:15187149).
Contributes to the adaptive immune response by enhancing signaling cascades that are triggered by T-cell activation, regulates differentiation and proliferation of activated T-cells (PubMed:17008549).
Promotes the differentiation of T-cells into Th1 cells and negatively regulates differentiation into Th2 cells (PubMed:17008549).
Has no effect on unstimulated T cells (PubMed:17008549).Promotes rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton, cell polarization and cell migration (PubMed:15187149).
Negatively regulates hormone exocytosis via activation of the formyl peptide receptors and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (PubMed:19625660).
Has high affinity for Ca2+ and can bind up to eight Ca2+ ions (By similarity).Displays Ca2+-dependent binding to phospholipid membranes (PubMed:2532504, PubMed:8557678).Plays a role in the formation of phagocytic cups and phagosomes. Plays a role in phagocytosis by mediating the Ca2+-dependent interaction between phagosomes and the actin cytoskeleton (By similarity).
Q26710^Catalyzes cyanide-resistant oxygen consumption. May increase respiration when the cytochrome respiratory pathway is restricted, or in response to low temperatures.
O95445^Probably involved in lipid transport. Can bind sphingosine-1-phosphate, myristic acid, palmitic acid and stearic acid, retinol, all-trans-retinoic acid and 9-cis-retinoic acid.
P08202^Catalyzes the conversion of L-arabinose to L-ribulose.
